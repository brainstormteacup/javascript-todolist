# javascript-todolist
I rehash my understanding of the firm basics by making a todo list.... It will get messy.

I will write my ponderings, notes and whatnot in this README and hope that this helps my brain latch onto what I learned a long time ago.

Pondering 1: Pathways are so important! The index can only see what is in the workspace. If something is in a folder, say the folder/file that I'm referring to.

Pondering 2: Not sure if this is because I picked a beginner video, but I noticed that flex was invoked several times rather than just once. I want to figure out how to cut down on that. Maybe this is why I like Sass more? Dunno. Every single time I needed to align things, there was dislay: flex. Goodness.

Pondering 3: I've never seen cursor before! I didn't know that you could alter it in the code. I have got to check out all the different kinds!

Pondering 4: In this project, the rows are first put in htmland then styled. And then it was put in the javascript. Fascinating. I want to get better at setting up for folding in code like this in the future.

Pondering 5: Debugging for me is not as intuitive in CSS. I think I might be better at Sass which is odd to me. Maybe this is because I'm rusty, or pathways are very tempermental in CSS? (Turns out it was a deprecation and in adressing that I was back up again.)

Pondering 6: Found out that background-image url sees too much (not just what is in the workspace) and thus needs a very specific path.

Pondering 7: Pseudo elements, I gotta learn more about them! My "biggest" plot twist (outside of cursor) was... what is the difference between :: and : ?

Pondering 8: Stupid question, why do we use ";" at the end of things in Javascript and CSS? And what does () actually mean?
